#  AI Clone Tracker

This project is a **real-time AI Clone Tracker** built with **Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Matplotlib**.  
It creates a **neon-style animated clone** of the user in both **2D and 3D space**, with glowing joints, trails, and dynamic colors.



##  Features
-  **Real-time pose tracking** using Mediapipe  
-  **Neon glow effects** with gradient colors and pulse animation  
-  **Trail effects** for smooth motion visualization  
-  **3D Clone view** with Matplotlib (interactive plot)  
-  **Lightweight & fast performance** (optimized with frame skipping)  
-  **"SCANNING‚Ä¶" mode** when no pose is detected  



##  Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10**
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV
  - Mediapipe
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Math & Time (built-in)
